        <b>What are the benefits of Version Control?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Version control allows us to track changes, and work on projects simultaneously without stepping on your teammates toes. But beyond that, it also helps us keep good tabs on the changes we make, and lets us revert back to a previous version if we have managed to screw up, we can simply go back to the master for a blank slate.

        <b>How does git help you keep track of changes?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to commit changes, we have to make comments. Comments are good practice because we have to explain the moves we are making, and make them in such a way that your teammates understand. That means writing them clearly and concisely, which, when you go back and read these commit messages a month later, it'll be clear to you.

        <b> Why use GitHub to store your code?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Because it's online. It's always safe. If your computer were to crash, if your computer fell out of a plane, if your computer was Rockbottomed by WWE Hall of Famer Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, your files will always be safe and accessible. The safety and peace of mind is worth it.
