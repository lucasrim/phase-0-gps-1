        So I watched <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">this</a> video today, and it hit me pretty hard. It talked a lot about our mentality going into this, and that it wasn't just some program where you plug in, do a little work, and boom. You have a job. I know it wasn't that, but I don't think I respected it enough. Earlier this week I lost a lot of my work because I was pushing my work onto the master, I lost a week's worth of reflections, and I was so frustrated that I would have to go through it all again. Looking back on it though, it was me being frustrated that the program was too hard, because I entered thinking it would be easy. It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be tough. Me being frustrated with it just shows how little reverance I had for the program, and today I feel pretty humbled, and all around silly. I will be spending the next couple hours rewriting a lot of my reflections, hopefully I'll stop being such a child about it and put in the work with a better attitude. It's not like an employer would accept my lazy attitudes, so I shouldn't let myself have this attitude either.
