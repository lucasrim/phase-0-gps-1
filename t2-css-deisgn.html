  <h2>Differences in Margin, Border, and Padding</h2>
    <p> 
      This is really simple, I think a lot of people get confused on this but it doesn't have to be a nightmare! So, padding is the space between the content and the border, and the margin is the space outside of the border. So, if there is formatting inside the border that you want to extend, simply put PADDING. I guess I can't really explain it beyond that...
